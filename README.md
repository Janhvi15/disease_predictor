***Smart Disease Prediction***

**Overview**

Smart Disease Prediction is an intelligent system designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on symptoms, medical history, or diagnostic data. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide early disease detection, empowering users to seek timely medical advice. Itâ€™s intended for educational purposes, research, and as a supportive tool for healthcare professionals, not as a replacement for professional medical diagnosis.

**Features**

Symptom-Based Prediction: Input symptoms to predict possible diseases with associated probabilities.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple GUI (built with Tkinter) for easy interaction.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes trained models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for accurate predictions.

Data Visualization: Displays prediction results with charts or graphs for better understanding.

Database Integration: Stores user inputs and prediction history using SQLite.

Extensible: Easily add new diseases, symptoms, or datasets to improve prediction accuracy.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language for development.

Scikit-Learn: For building and training machine learning models.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.

SQLite: For persistent storage of user data and prediction history.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing prediction results and model performance.
